**Last Updated:** 2 January 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how [Your Company Name] (""we,"" ""us,"" or ""our"") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use the WorkoutLog mobile application (the ""App"").

**Disclaimer:** This is a template and NOT legal advice. You MUST have this policy reviewed by a qualified legal professional to ensure it complies with all applicable laws and regulations (like GDPR, CCPA, etc.) before publishing it.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect various types of information in connection with the services provided by our App, including:

### 1.1. Information You Provide Directly

*   **Account Information:** When you create an account, we collect your email address and a user ID (managed through Firebase Authentication).
*   **Workout Data:** Information you input about your workouts, including exercise names, sets, repetitions, weights, duration, rest times, workout plans, and any personal notes. This data is stored in our backend (Firebase Realtime Database) and locally on your device.
*   **Running Data:** Details about your runs, including duration, distance, pace, and notes, when you manually log them within the App.
*   **Personal Stats:** Optional information such as your body weight, which is used for personalized tracking within the App.

### 1.2. Information from Third-Party Services

*   **Google Health Connect:** With your explicit permission, the App can read data from your Google Health Connect account, specifically running session data such as start time, end time, duration, distance, and any associated notes. This data is then processed and stored within the App (locally and potentially synced to our backend) to be incorporated into your workout history. We handle this data in accordance with Google's Health Connect policies and our own privacy commitments.
*   **Google Firebase:** We use Google Firebase for:
    *   **Authentication:** To manage user accounts and secure access to your data.
    *   **Realtime Database:** To store and sync your workout data (logs, plans, personal stats).
    *   **Analytics:** To understand how users interact with the App, which helps us improve its features and performance. This includes usage patterns and device information, but does not identify you personally.
    *   **Crashlytics:** To collect crash reports and performance monitoring data to fix bugs and improve stability.
*   **Google Play Billing:** When you make in-app purchases or subscribe to premium features, Google Play handles the payment processing. While we do not store your financial details, we receive information about your subscription status, tier, and purchase dates to manage your access to premium features.

### 1.3. Information Collected Automatically (Usage Data)

*   **Device Information:** We may collect information about the mobile device you use to access the App, including the hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers.
*   **App Usage Data:** We collect information about how you use the App, such as the features you access, the duration of your sessions, and other diagnostic data. This is primarily collected via Firebase Analytics in an aggregated and anonymized form.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:

*   **To Provide and Maintain the App:** To deliver the core functionalities of workout tracking, planning, logging, and performance analysis.
*   **To Authenticate Users:** To allow you to securely log in and access your personalized data.
*   **To Personalize Your Experience:** To display your workout history, active plans, and generate insights based on your data.
*   **To Process Subscriptions:** To manage your access to premium features and services.
*   **AI Data Analysis (User Initiated):** If you choose to engage with our AI Coach feature, your relevant workout data (including exercise names, sets, reps, weight) will be securely transmitted to a third-party AI service for analysis. This is done **only when you explicitly initiate** this feature within the App, and the purpose is to provide you with personalized suggestions and recommendations to improve your training.
*   **To Improve the App:** To understand usage trends, diagnose technical issues, and improve the App's features, performance, and user experience.
*   **To Communicate with You:** To respond to your inquiries, provide customer support, and send you important service-related notices.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We may share your information in the following situations:

*   **With Service Providers:** We share information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating the App and performing services on our behalf (e.g., Google Firebase for backend infrastructure, authentication, and analytics; Google Play for billing services).
*   **With AI Service Provider:** When you utilize the AI Coach feature, specific workout data necessary for the AI's analysis is shared with our designated AI service provider. We ensure these providers are contractually bound to protect your data and only process it for the purposes of providing the AI coaching service.
*   **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
*   **Business Transfers:** In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your personal data may be transferred.

**We do not sell your personal information to third parties.**

## 4. Data Retention

We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the App's services. If you delete your account, your personal data will be deleted from our servers within a reasonable timeframe, unless we are required to retain it for legal obligations.

## 5. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
