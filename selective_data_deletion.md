# Selective Data Deletion Policy for Athlex

**Last Updated:** 2 January 2026

This page explains how users can manage and request the deletion of specific data within the Athlex app, without needing to delete their entire account.

## Your Control Over Your Data

Athlex is designed to give you control over your personal fitness data. You can delete much of your data directly within the app. For any data you cannot delete yourself, you can request its deletion from us.

## How to Delete Data Within the App

You can delete the following types of data directly from within the Athlex application:

*   **Workout Plans:**
    *   Navigate to the "Plans" section of the App.
    *   Find the plan you wish to delete from the list.
    *   Follow the in-app instructions (e.g., long-press or swipe to reveal a delete option, or access a menu to delete the plan).
*   **Workout Logs/Sessions:**
    *   Navigate to your "Workout History" or "Logs" section.
    *   Select the specific workout session or log entry you wish to delete.
    *   Follow the in-app instructions to remove the entry.
*   **Running Logs:**
    *   Go to the "Run History" screen.
    *   Select the individual running log entry you wish to remove.
    *   Follow the in-app instructions to delete it.

**Important:** Deleting data within the app is permanent and cannot be undone.

## How to Request Deletion of Other Data

If you wish to delete data that you cannot remove directly through the App's interface, or if you need assistance with data deletion, please contact our support team.

To request the deletion of specific data:

1.  Send an email to our support team at: **buhtlawdzemstudios@gmail.com**
2.  In the subject line of the email, please write: **"Specific Data Deletion Request - [Your Athlex Account Email]"**
3.  In the body of the email, clearly describe the specific data you wish to have deleted. Be as precise as possible (e.g., "delete all workout logs from January 2025" or "delete my body weight records").

## What Data Cannot Be Deleted Selectively?

Some data types are intrinsically linked to your account and cannot be deleted without deleting your entire account. For instance, your user account ID or basic registration information. If you wish to delete all data, including your account information, please refer to our [Account Deletion Policy](data_deletion.html).

## Processing Time

We will process your data deletion request within a reasonable timeframe, typically within 30 days of receiving your verified request. For in-app deletions, the data is removed instantly from your device and synchronizes with our backend.
